# Book_Search 

## Developers Comment 

I worked on creating a basic application with React as my frontend and Express as my backend server. MongoDB was also used to create my models and schema. The goal was to create a book searching app that worked with the Google Books API in order to get correct information based on the search of the user. 

I was not able to complete it mainly because I was running out of time, and I do plan on returning to this application and finishing it. I wrote some pseudocode in the frontend src folder that explains what's left to do.
